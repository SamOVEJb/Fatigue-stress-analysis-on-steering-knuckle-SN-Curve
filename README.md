# Fatigue-stress-analysis-on-steering-knuckle-SN-Curve
This project focuses on performing fatigue stress analysis on a steering knuckle, utilizing the SN curve approach for a cast iron material. The primary objective is to assess the steering knuckleâ€™s durability under cyclic loading, using ANSYS Workbench to simulate the stresses and predict the fatigue life based on material behavior.
